Analyze accounts in a notepad with the name "facu.txt" if the account exceeds X amount of followed and X amount of followers will store it in a dictionary together with the date of last publication, add exceptions to skip private accounts and those that does not find. If an error arises with the accounts, store them in another notepad to go through the program again. If we execute the program right now in "facu.txt" the accounts that exceed 30 followers would be stored, in "blocked.txt" those that could not be analyzed in "nosirven.txt" those that did not exceed 30 followers
